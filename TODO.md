# Outstanding Tasks

## Bugs

- Toggling scripts causes a crash.

## Bundling

- Look at creating a manifest generator webpack plugin to mitigate dealing with keeping the package.json, source manifest.json, and JavaScript output paths aligned

## Bundles

- Investigate output bundles and their file sizes for further chunk-splitting optimizations.

# TODOs

## Bugs

- Toggling a script occasionally causes the UI to crasb.
- Investigate possible memory leaks.

## Builds

### Development

- Look at creating a manifest generator webpack plugin to mitigate dealing with keeping the package.json, source manifest.json, and JavaScript output paths aligned

### Bundles

- Investigate output bundles and their file sizes for further chunk-splitting optimizations.
